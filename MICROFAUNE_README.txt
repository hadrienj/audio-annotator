- In the terminal, navigate to the repo root folder
- Launch server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
- Visit <http://localhost:8000/examples>
- Choose the wav directory (Do not select any files, just the directory)
- Accept the dialog to import files
- You can then listen, and drag and drop on the spectrogram zones you identify,
then click on the 'BIRD' tag. Repeat as many times as you identify zones.
